Instructions to use the kern2nm.m function: 

1 - unzip the EFSC German and Chinese songs (the subsets have been filtered so that no songs with rests are included). 

2 - run the kern2nm.m function. At this time only a relatively small number of songs can be processed at a time (<100). The textread function of MATLAB does not seem to be able to handle more large number of txt files without crashing.

	Example: 

	germanAllerkbd = kern2nm()
	germandva = kern2nm()
	germanKinder = kern2nm()
	germanFink = kern2nm()
	germanZuccal = kern2nm()
	germanVariant = kern2nm() 

3 - contactate the resulting subests. 

	Example 

	combinedGerman = [germanAllerkbd,germanAltdeu, germanBallad, germanBoheme, germandva, germanErk, germanFink, germanKinder, germanVariant, germanZuccal]
	
Good luck!
